# Bash bricks ðŸ§±

![ci](https://github.com/filisko/bash-bricks/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Simple Bash framework that provides carefully crafted functions with good practices from the Bash and shell scripts community, and some of my own inventions.

## Installation

Clone the git repo (or download the zip) wherever your scripts will be located:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:filisko/bash-bricks.git
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"

# simply load 
source "$DIR/path-to-bash-bricks/boot.sh"
# load the modules you need
source "$BB_LIB_DIR/curl.sh"
```
